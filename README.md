# Hey there 👋

I’m a curious mind who can’t resist diving deep into the world of Large Language Models. What started as casual late-night reading of research papers has turned into a full-on obsession with prompts, fine-tuning, and the occasional “what if” experiment that spirals way too far. I enjoy exploring not just *what* these models can do, but also *why* they behave the way they do—sometimes elegant, sometimes baffling, always fascinating.  

When I’m not tinkering with code or testing the limits of context windows, I’m usually documenting my findings, building small experimental tools, or ranting about model quirks that feel almost human. I believe that LLMs are more than just an engineering marvel—they’re a new medium for thought, creativity, and collaboration. This repo is my personal space to share experiments, ideas, and maybe a few rants along the way.  

If you’re into prompt sorcery, model interpretability, or just want to watch someone joyfully break things to see what happens, you’ll probably feel right at home here. 🚀
